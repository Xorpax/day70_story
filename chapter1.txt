This is a lesson about using git and github version control

to start off, use ``git init`` to initialise a repository

staging are contains information about what will go into your next commit

git add <file name> to add items to the staging area for the next commit

conversley you can use ``git add .`` to add all the files not being ignored to the staging area

git status will show the current state of the working directory and the staging area

git commit -m [descriptive message] to commit

git log will show the history of commits
( press q to exit the log )

git checkout will update the working directory to match the version in the index or the
specific tree (basically works like a rollback or synchronising with one version of the repo)

``touch .gitignore`` to create a gitignore file. This file contains any files and/or file
extensions that will be ignored and will not be added to the staging area. Especially useful
when dealing with sensitive data, such as API keys or data that is irrelevant and will only
bloat the repo
