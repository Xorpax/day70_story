Branching and merging

git branch <branch-name> will create a branch from the repo tree. It can be updated alongside
the main branch, as they will not collide.

git merge <branch-name> merges a branch with the main branch. This can be used after
writing a separate module of a program to add it to the main version of the project.

git branch by itself will list available branches

to switch to a specific branch, use ``git checkout <branch-name>``
